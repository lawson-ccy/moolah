Please review the changes for any potential security vulnerabilities, logical flaws, gas inefficiencies, or deviation from best practices.\n\nAlso included are the Slither static analysis results (which may contain duplicated or low-confidence findings).\n\nYour task:\n\n1. Carefully analyze the PR diff and Slither findings together.\n2. Identify and explain any **security vulnerabilities**, **incorrect logic**, or **critical design flaws**.\n3. Rate each issue with one of the following severities: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Informational`.\n4. For each issue, specify:\n   - Affected contract name\n   - A concise issue title\n   - A short explanation of the problem\n   - A concrete recommendation to fix it\n\n5. If there are **no major issues**, you must still return the table with one `Informational` row explaining \"No significant issues found\".\n\n6. Format the output as a Markdown table:\n\n| Severity | Contract | Issue | Recommendation |\n|----------|----------|-------|----------------|\n| High     | MyToken  | Missing access control in `mint()` | Add `onlyOwner` or proper modifier to restrict access |\n| ...      | ...      | ...   | ...            |\n\n---\n\n### PR DIFF:\n```\n<PR_DIFF_PLACEHOLDER>\n```\n\n### SLITHER FINDINGS:\n```\n<SLITHER_FINDINGS_PLACEHOLDER>\n```"
