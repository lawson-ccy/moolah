          - Blocking Review: ${{ env.BLOCKING_REVIEW }}
          Objectives:
          1) Re-check existing review comments and reply resolved when addressed.
          2) Review the current PR diff and flag only clear, high-severity issues.
          3) Leave very short inline comments (1-2 sentences) on changed lines only and a brief summary at the end.
          Procedure:
          - Get existing comments: gh pr view --json comments
          - Get diff: gh pr diff
          - Get changed files with patches to compute inline positions: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/files --paginate --jq '.[] | {filename,patch}'
          - Compute exact inline anchors for each issue (file path + diff position). Comments MUST be placed inline on the changed line in the diff, not as top-level comments.
          - Detect prior top-level "no issues" style comments authored by this bot (match bodies like: "✅ no issues", "No issues found", "LGTM").
          - If CURRENT run finds issues and any prior "no issues" comments exist:
            - Prefer to remove them to avoid confusion:
              - Try deleting top-level issue comments via: gh api -X DELETE repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/comments/<comment_id>
              - If deletion isn't possible, minimize them via GraphQL (minimizeComment) or edit to prefix "[Superseded by new findings]".
            - If neither delete nor minimize is possible, reply to that comment: "⚠️ Superseded: issues were found in newer commits".
          - If a previously reported issue appears fixed by nearby changes, reply: ✅ This issue appears to be resolved by the recent changes
          - Analyze ONLY for:
            - Null/undefined dereferences
            - Resource leaks (unclosed files or connections)
            - Injection (SQL/XSS)
            - Concurrency/race conditions
            - Missing error handling for critical operations
            - Obvious logic errors with incorrect behavior
            - Clear performance anti-patterns with measurable impact
            - Definitive security vulnerabilities
          - Avoid duplicates: skip if similar feedback already exists on or near the same lines.
          Commenting rules:
          - Max 10 inline comments total; prioritize the most critical issues
          - One issue per comment; place on the exact changed line
          - All issue comments MUST be inline (anchored to a file and line/position in the PR diff)
          - Natural tone, specific and actionable; do not mention automated or high-confidence
          - Use emojis: 🚨 Critical 🔒 Security ⚡ Performance ⚠️ Logic ✅ Resolved ✨ Improvement
          Submission:
          - If there are NO issues to report and an existing top-level comment indicating "no issues" already exists (e.g., "✅ no issues", "No issues found", "LGTM"), do NOT submit another comment. Skip submission to avoid redundancy.
          - If there are NO issues to report and NO prior "no issues" comment exists, submit one brief summary comment noting no issues.
          - If there ARE issues to report and a prior "no issues" comment exists, ensure that prior comment is deleted/minimized/marked as superseded before submitting the new review.
          - If there ARE issues to report, submit ONE review containing ONLY inline comments plus an optional concise summary body. Use the GitHub Reviews API to ensure comments are inline:
            - Build a JSON array of comments like: [{ "path": "<file>", "position": <diff_position>, "body": "..." }]
            - Submit via: gh api repos/${{ github.repository }}/pulls/${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}/reviews -f event=COMMENT -f body="$SUMMARY" -f comments='[$COMMENTS_JSON]'
          - Do NOT use: gh pr review --approve or --request-changes
          Blocking behavior:
          - If BLOCKING_REVIEW is true and any 🚨 or 🔒 issues were posted: echo "CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND=true" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          - Otherwise: echo "CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND=false" >> $GITHUB_ENV
          - Always set CRITICAL_ISSUES_FOUND at the end
